# AI Cheerish

AI Cheerish is a lightweight Python library designed to enhance your AI chatbot's performance by injecting motivational and inspirational messages into conversation prompts. It integrates seamlessly with your existing AI client and automatically logs interactions for improved debugging and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Prompt Enhancement:** Automatically inject a custom "human nature" message on the first interaction and add motivational notes periodically (every nth message, as set in your configuration).
- **Easy Integration:** Works with any AI client that follows a conversational API pattern.
- **Logging:** Records conversation details including timestamps, original messages, enhanced prompts, and AI responses in a CSV file.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

pip install ai-cheerish

## Usage Example

from ai_cheerish import Cheerish

def dummy_get_response(messages):
    return "Dummy response: " + messages[0]["content"]

# Pass the function directly instead of creating a class instance.
cheerish = Cheerish(dummy_get_response)

response = cheerish("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)



## How It Works

1. **Message Enhancement:** 
   - On the first user message, the library can prepend a configured "human_nature" note.
   - Every nth message (by default, every 3rd messageâ€”modifiable via the `motivational_frequency` setting) gets an additional motivational note injected.
2. **Single API Call:** 
   - Instead of sending separate system and user messages, the system note is prepended directly to the user's message.
3. **Logging:** 
   - Each interaction is logged in a CSV file (`chat_logs.csv`) for later review or debugging.
